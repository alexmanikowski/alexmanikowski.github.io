             Alex has been climbing since 1998 when he was 8 years old. He grew up in Lake Mary, Florida and started climbing at the local climbing gym, Aiguille. He was intrigued from the first day by the movement climbing offered. Sometimes so fluid and natural, and at other times so intricate and precise, he became instantly obsessed with it. 

Striving to work towards something that at first seemed impossible, Alex's continuous motivation has helped him to understand and appreciate every facet of the sport. Over the years, climbing has blossomed into a lifestyle and has taken Alex to some amazing places, introduced him to a unique community, and ultimately kept him inspired to keep getting better. 

Alex mainly focuses on bouldering and has climbed numerous V13 (8B) boulders, while rapidly working towards his goal of V15 (8C). Alex not only excels in bouldering but also sport climbing. He has climbed up to 5.14a/b or (8b+) and has been projecting many 5.14d (9a) routes.
